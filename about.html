      <h2 class="h2">Hi, Iâ€™m Chiranjeevi. Nice to meet you.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Master's student hailing from San Jose State University, nestled
        in the heart of vibrant San Jose, CA, USA. With over three years of
        professional software development under my belt, I bring a wealth of
        experience to the table. My journey began with a stellar education at
        PES University in India, where I honed my skills and laid the foundation
        for my future endeavors. From there, I embarked on an exciting chapter
        as a Software Engineer at Novartis in Hyderabad, where I delved deep
        into the world of software development, gaining invaluable insights
        along the way. But the adventure didn't stop there. I seized the
        opportunity to spread my wings further as a Software Intern at Global
        Payments, broadening my horizons and refining my craft. Currently, I'm
        leading a dynamic team of three at San Jose State University, managing
        innovative projects and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the
        tech realm. My expertise spans across Full Stack technologies, DevOps
        Development, and Systems Engineering, allowing me to navigate complex
        challenges with ease. As an avid open-source contributor, I thrive on
        collaboration and the spirit of community-driven innovation. When I'm
        not immersed in code, you'll find me hitting the courts, indulging my
        passion for basketball, or cheering on my favorite teams from the
        sidelines. It's all about finding balance and embracing the diverse
        tapestry of life's experiences. Welcome to my portfolio, where
        creativity meets functionality, and every line of code tells a story.
        Let's embark on this journey together, shaping the future, one project
        at a time.
