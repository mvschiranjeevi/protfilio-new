After you got the template please open it in the code editor of your choice.
You will find a file named `index.html` open it and follow the guidance inscribed within the comments to customize the template.

**For example:**

```html
<!-- Update with your name -->
<title>Chiranjeevi Portfolio</title>
```

```html
<div class="header-textbox">
  <!-- Replace with your name & job title -->
  <h1 class="h1">Hi, I'm Chiranjeevi, a Software Enginner</h1>

  <!-- Add a small introductory paragraph about yourself -->
  <p class="header-text">A software engineer and architect</p>
</div>
```

**Note:** While editing the template make sure you have updated all `href`, img `src` and `alt` attributes of links and images.
